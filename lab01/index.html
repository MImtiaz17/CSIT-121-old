	<h3>Why This Recipie</h3>
	<p>Lately I've been trying to eat healthier and wanted to try making salads. I was never really a salad person aside from eating chana chaat (Pakistani appetizer). I wanted an easy salad that still tasted somewhat familure to my current pallete (as someone who primarily eats Paksitani food). So after researching some recipies, I found one that I liked the most and now use often: this recipie. I hope you like it!</p>
	<h4> Ingredients</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Cucumbers, ideally Persian cucumbers but regular works fine</li>
		<li>Tomatoes, ideally firm ones (ex:roma) but any tomatoes work </li>

	</ul>
    <h5> Steps</h5>

    <h6> Tips and Tricks</h6>
    <ol>
    	<li><b>De-seed tomatoes for ideal results:</b> there's a lot of water in tomatoes especially when diced. So if you have the time, remove the seeds and save it for something else.</li>
    	<li><b>Chop everything evenly:</b> It helps making your salad look good and make bites more enjoyable.</li>
    	<li><b>Toss salad immediately before serving:</b> The salad should be fresh and crunchy, so tossing it right away gives the best results.</li>
    	<li><b>Taste and adjust seasoning with sald and lime juice:</b> Depeding on size and taste of the salad, you may need to adjust to your liking.</li>
