		<h3>Why This Recipe</h3>
			<p>Lately I've been trying to eat healthier and wanted to try making salads. I was never really a salad person aside from eating chana chaat (Pakistani appetizer). I wanted an easy salad that still tasted somewhat familiar to my current palette (as someone who primarily eats Pakistani food). So after researching some recipes, I found one that I liked the most and now use often: this recipe. I hope you like it!</p>

		<h3> Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Cucumbers, ideally Persian cucumbers but regular works fine</li>
				<li>Tomatoes, ideally firm ones (Ex:Roma) but any tomatoes work </li>
				<li>Red Onion </li>
				<li>Fresh herbs, Cilantro and Parsley are commonly used either or both. Dried mint is also used, pick what you prefer </li>
				<li>Dressing
					<ul>
						<li>extra vigin olive oil</li>
						<li>lime juice</li>
						<li>salt and pepper</li>
		   			 </ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

    	<h3>Steps</h3>
   			 <ol>
    			<li>Dice/chop all of the ingridents (minus the dressing) and make them unifrom</li>
    			<li>For the dressing, its recommended to whisk all the dressing ingridients together in the serving bowl, and then add the salad ingridients and toss for less cleanup</li>
   			 </ol>

   		 <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
   			 <ol>
    			<li><b>De-seed tomatoes for ideal results:</b> there's a lot of water in tomatoes especially when diced. So if you have the time, remove the seeds and save it for something else.</li>
    			<li><b>Chop everything evenly:</b> It helps making your salad look good and make bites more enjoyable.</li>
    			<li><b>Toss salad immediately before serving:</b> The salad should be fresh and crunchy, so tossing it right away gives the best results.</li>
    			<li><b>Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and lime juice:</b> Depending on size and taste of the salad, you may need to adjust to your liking.</li>
   				</ol>
